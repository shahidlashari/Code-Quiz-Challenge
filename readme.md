Description:

The purpose of this assignment was to create a timer-based coding assessment using vanilla JavaScript that behaves like so. an interactive challenge prompted to user, having a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has feature of a clean and polished user interface and responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. Timed quiz stores high scores
for user to gauge his progress.

After hitting quiz button timer starts and presents with a question to select answer from mulitple choices and another question is presented immediately.If the answer of a question is incorrect then time is subtracted from the clock by 10 seconds. it prompts the user whether answer is correct or wrong. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. WHEN the game is over then it saves user's initials and score in local storage. High scores are presented at the end.

The website is also a responsive layout for mobile screens, which means that the elements are nicely fit in different screens sizes.

The quiz website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices , whereas in the javascript file, it contains variables (large amounts), objects, functions, for-loops, and if-else statements.

Technologies:

.HTML
.CSS 
.Javascript
.Bootstrap
.Visual Studio Code

Challenges:

This entire activity was very difficult. I really don't understand what I'm doing with the DOM and Local storage and it took forever just to figure out how to get my timer working. I didn't understand how to display the questions individually or if I needed to use JSON methods so I couldn't move forward for the longest time. I tried looking at online sources and class examples multiple times and was still confused after 2 days with several hours of the same cycle. I feel like my comprehension is lagging compared to the pace of this subject matter. I was slightly overwhelmed with numerous thoughts, however ,I started my pseudo-code .I went through lecture videos and also looking through a couple of password generator examples online in order to understand javascript code.

I was able to solve each of my problems ultimately through persistent efforts and looking at online resources!
