This app runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has feature of a clean and polished user interface and responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. Timed quiz stores high scores
for user to gauge his progress.

After hitting quiz button timer starts and presents with a question to select answer from mulitple choices and another question is presented immediately.If the answer of a question is incorrect then time is subtracted from the clock by 10 seconds. it prompts the user whether answer is correct or wrong.

Challenges:

This entire activity was very difficult. I really don't understand what I'm doing with the DOM and Local storage and it took forever just to figure out how to get my timer working. I didn't understand how to display the questions individually or if I needed to use JSON methods so I couldn't move forward for the longest time. I tried looking at online sources and class examples multiple times and was still confused after 2 days with several hours of the same cycle. I feel like my comprehension is lagging compared to the pace of this subject matter. I was slightly overwhelmed with numerous thoughts, however ,I started my pseudo-code .I went through lecture videos and also looking through a couple of password generator examples online in order to understand javascript code.

I was able to solve each of my problems ultimately through persistent efforts and looking at online resources!
